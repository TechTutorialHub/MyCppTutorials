Functions

Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They allow us to break down complex programs into smaller, manageable sections, making our code more modular and reusable. In C++, functions are typically written outside the main function, then called within the main function or other parts of the program. 


Different types of functions

Function (No Argument and No Return Value)
Function (No Argument but Return Value)
Function (Argument but No Return Value)
Function (Argument and Return Value)
